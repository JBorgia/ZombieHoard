# I Am Legend 2.0
2nd Group Project in Quad 2 created 18 November 2016

INTRODUCTION:
--------------------
This will be a Spring/MVC CRUD project designed, built, and deployed to cloud services over a period of 14 days.

STORYLINE:
--------------------

-Alternative interpretation or prequel to the popular movie, I Am Legend.  In the not so distant future more than half of the worlds population has contracted a lethal and deforming virus that has  made them threats to non-carriers of the virus.  Society has fallen in to a state of dystopia i.e anarchy, frequent purges, and martial law have made the government all but effective in maintaining peace and safety for its citizens.  In a last ditch effort to provide refuge for the few remaining, survival stations have been establish throughout each region providing weapons, food, and miscellaneous items necessary to increase survivability.  Citizens may make a once per 30-90 day purchase depending no their region, and my not purchase more than 40lbs of supplies.  Due to shortages, limited resupply, and crime it is up to each citizen to strategically purchase items relevant to their geographic area.  In order to access supplies at a station you must register at which point the government will credit each registered citizen $1000.00 for the purchase of goods.  Upon successful registration at a station each member's profile page will provide updates to crime, weather, and political, and socioeconomic data to be used for selecting items appropriate to each region.  Finally, upon check out of supplies each member will receive a summary and estimate of their chances of survival based on the items purchased.
